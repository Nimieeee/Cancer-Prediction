🧬 Cancer Gene Expression Analysis using RNA-seq Data from BARRA:CuRDa
This project is inspired by my learning journey through the book Deep Learning for Genomics, and it applies deep learning concepts to real-world RNA-seq data for cancer research.

📚 Learning Context
The project is part of my self-study based on the book Deep Learning for Genomics, which introduces foundational concepts in applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to biological data, particularly high-dimensional data like gene expression profiles.

🧪 Dataset: BARRA:CuRDa
BARRA:CuRDa is a curated RNA-seq database for cancer research, comprising 17 rigorously selected datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The datasets were chosen based on strict quality control and metadata curation, making them ideal for meaningful downstream analysis.

🧠 Project Highlights
RNA-seq data preprocessing and normalization

Visualization of gene expression distributions

Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)

Exploratory clustering (e.g., K-Means)

Discussion on differential gene expression and pathway insights

Foundation for applying neural networks in future work

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Scikit-learn for ML techniques

Jupyter Notebook for analysis

Future extension: PyTorch/TensorFlow for neural networks

🎯 Goal
To build practical skills in processing and analyzing omics data, bridge theory and implementation of deep learning techniques, and explore the potential of applying machine learning in cancer biology.
